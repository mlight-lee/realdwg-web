/**
 * Represents a record in the line type table within the AutoCAD drawing database.
 * 
 * Each line type table record contains the information necessary to define a specific line type,
 * including its pattern, description, and rendering characteristics. Line types define how lines
 * are drawn, including patterns of dashes, dots, and spaces.
 *
 * Within the line type table record, the dashes (line segments that make up characteristics of the
 * linetype) are stored in a list with an index that is zero based. If the linetype is complex, then
 * embedded shapes or text strings are stored in the list at the same index as the dash that preceded
 * them in the linetype definition. So there will always be a dashLength for any valid index in the
 * list, even if there is a shape or text string sharing the same index. When the linetype is elaborated,
 * a shape's insertion point will coincide with the end of the dash that it shares an index with.
