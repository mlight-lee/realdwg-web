 * Represents an xline entity in AutoCAD.
 *
 * An xline is a 3D geometric object that extends infinitely in both directions from a base point.
 * Xlines are commonly used for construction lines, reference lines, and temporary geometry.
 * Unlike lines, xlines have no end points and extend to infinity in both directions.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create an xline from origin in the positive X direction
 * const xline = new AcDbXline();
 * xline.basePoint = new AcGePoint3d(0, 0, 0);
 * xline.unitDir = new AcGeVector3d(1, 0, 0);
 *
 * // Access xline properties
 * console.log(`Base point: ${xline.basePoint}`);
 * console.log(`Unit direction: ${xline.unitDir}`);
