/**
 * Represents a trace entity in AutoCAD.
 * 
 * A trace is a 3D geometric object that represents a filled four-sided polygon.
 * It is typically used to create trace-like shapes and can be visualized as a
 * "filled polyline" with four vertices, where each edge connects two consecutive points.
 * 
 * This entity was more commonly used in earlier versions of AutoCAD, especially before
 * the introduction of more advanced entities like solid and hatches. Today, it's not
 * as commonly used since solid provides similar capabilities with more flexibility.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Create a trace entity
 * const trace = new AcDbTrace();
 * trace.setPointAt(0, new AcGePoint3d(0, 0, 0));
 * trace.setPointAt(1, new AcGePoint3d(10, 0, 0));
 * trace.setPointAt(2, new AcGePoint3d(10, 5, 0));
 * trace.setPointAt(3, new AcGePoint3d(0, 5, 0));
 * 
 * // Access trace properties
 * console.log(`Elevation: ${trace.elevation}`);
 * console.log(`Thickness: ${trace.thickness}`);
 * ```
