/**
 * Represents a diametric dimension entity in AutoCAD.
 *
 * This dimension type measures the diameter of a circle or arc by defining two points
 * that lie on the curve and are diametrically opposite each other. Diametric dimensions
 * are essential for circular features in mechanical drawings, architectural plans, and
 * other technical documentation.
 *
 * The dimension behavior varies based on text placement:
 * - If the text is inside the curve being dimensioned, the dimension line will be drawn
 *   from the farChordPoint to the chordPoint, with a break for the annotation text.
 * - If the dimension text is outside the curve being dimensioned, the dimension line is
 *   drawn from the farChordPoint, through the chordPoint, and extends out the leaderLength
 *   distance past the chordPoint, where it will do a short horizontal dogleg (if appropriate)
 *   to the annotation text.
