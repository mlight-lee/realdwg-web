 * Represents an ordinate dimension entity in AutoCAD.

 * from a specified origin point to some other specified point. They are commonly used
 * in mechanical drawings, architectural plans, and other technical documentation where
 * precise coordinate measurements are required.
 *
 * The dimension displays a leader line from the defining point to the leader end point,
 * with the annotation text located appropriately near the end of the leader. Ordinate
 * dimensions are particularly useful for dimensioning parts with multiple features that
 * need to be positioned relative to a common reference point.
