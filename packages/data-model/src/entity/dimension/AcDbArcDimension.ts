/**
 * Represents an arc length dimension entity in AutoCAD.
 *
 * This dimension type measures the length of an arc by defining the arc's center point,
 * two points that define the arc's extent, and a point on the arc itself. Arc length
 * dimensions are commonly used in mechanical drawings, architectural plans, and other
 * technical documentation where precise arc measurements are required.
 *
 * The dimension displays the actual arc length value and typically includes extension
 * lines, dimension lines, and arrows positioned to clearly indicate the arc being measured.
