/**
 * Abstract base class for all curve entities.
 * 
 * This class provides the fundamental functionality for all curve entities,
 * including the ability to determine if a curve is closed. A curve is
 * considered closed if its start point is identical to its end point.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * class MyCurve extends AcDbCurve {
 *   get closed(): boolean {
 *     // Implementation to determine if curve is closed
 *     return this.startPoint.equals(this.endPoint);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 */
export abstract class AcDbCurve extends AcDbEntity {
  /**
   * Returns true if the curve is closed.
   * 
   * A curve is considered closed if its start point is identical to its end point.
   * This property is used by various operations that need to know if a curve
   * forms a complete loop.
   * 
   * @returns True if the curve is closed, false otherwise
   * 
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * const curve = new AcDbCircle();
   * console.log('Is circle closed?', curve.closed); // true
   * 
   * const line = new AcDbLine();
   * console.log('Is line closed?', line.closed); // false
   * ```
